# AWS Cost Optimization: EC2 Right Sizing

A multiple account fork of the AWS solution "Cost Optimization: EC2 Right Sizing".

For the original solution, please see [Cost Optimization: EC2 Right Sizing](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/cost-optimization-ec2-right-sizing/).


# How the Solution Works

To grab data from multiple AWS accounts, this solution uses an IAM role from an administrator account (where you launch the cloudformation stack) that assumes into *n* child accounts. This is possible because of:
>For example, if you switch to RoleA, IAM uses your original user or federated role credentials to determine if you are allowed to assume RoleA. If you then switch to RoleB *while you are using RoleA*, IAM still uses your **original** user or federated role credentials to authorize the switch, not the credentials for RoleA.  
[source AWS doc link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html)

Good news is that one half of the equation is already done (the EC2 worker in the admin account has sts:assumerole permission). You will now need to create a new IAM role in each of the target accounts (including in the administrator account itself) to allow cross account role assumption.

# Prerequisites

## Configure IAM roles across AWS Accounts

Each of the following items has to be configured for the solution to work.

1. Name of the IAM role has to be the **same** across all AWS accounts (ie. cost-optimization-get-cw-data). The name of the role will be used later as a CloudFormation input to feed into the code.
2. IAM Role (cost-optimization-get-cw-data) with the following permissions to scrape CW data. Create a new policy if needed.
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "MultiAccountCostOptimization",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
3. The IAM Role has a Trust Relationship with the administrator account. See example policy document below. Replace **\<AdministratorAWSAccountID\>** with your 12 digit account ID

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowingCrossAccountCWScraper",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AdministratorAWSAccountID>:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Remember, the above IAM role has to be created for the administrator account as well as the EC2 worker assumes into itself as well.**

## [Example] Using CloudFormation StackSets to deploy IAM roles

This will enable an administrative account to push [CloudFormation StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html) to sub-accounts for creating the required IAM roles. For StackSets to work, it requires a one time set up to [grant permissions for Stack Set Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html).
Use the following instructions to set this up using the provided cloudformation templates.

### Setting up CloudFormation StackSets

1. Create the **StackSet Administration** role in the **administrative account**, by executing the following command:

    Go into the templates directory
    ``` shell
    cd cost-optimization-multi/
    cd templates/
    ```

    Deploy the **StackSetAdministration** role with the AWS CLI tool
    ```shell
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name cfn-stackset-admin-role --template-body file://AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole.yml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --region us-east-1
    ```
    
1. Create the **StackSetExecution** role to both the **administrative account** and all **sub-accounts** by executing the following command.

    `Make sure to replace <ADMINACCOUNTID> with your own admin account ID below:`

  ``` shell
  aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name cfn-stackset-execution-role --template-body file://AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole.yml --parameters ParameterKey=AdministratorAccountId,ParameterValue=<ADMINACCOUNTID> --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --region us-east-1
  ```

### Deploying the prerequisite IAM roles for AWS Cost Optimization: EC2 Right Sizing

1. Create the cost-optimization-get-cw-data role in each of the accounts, including the **administrative account** by deploying the `cost-optimization-role-stackset.yaml` CloudFormation template as a StackSet across all sub-accounts.



# Instructions

1. Clone into the repo

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/saltysoup/cost-optimization-multi.git
    ```

1. Verify that the prereq IAM roles has been created in each AWS accounts

1. Create a new CloudFormation stack from the **administrator account** using **cost-optimization-ec2-right-sizing.json** in the templates directory.

1. In the launch parameters, input the AWS accounts (including the administrative account) and the name of the AWS Role that was configured in prerequisites.

1. The stack will take about 15min to finish (more for larger number of AWS accounts), with the results stored in the S3Bucket in the Resources tab.

- callgcw.py
- deleteandterminate.py
- getcloudwatchmetrics.py
- run-rightsizing-redshift.py

# Troubleshooting
Log files are exported to the CloudWatch Logs log group cost-optimization-ec2-right-sizing, log streams:
{instance_id}/cfn-init.log
{instance_id}/run-rightsizing-redshift.log
{instance_id}/deleteandterminate.log

Log files are also located locally on the solution created EC2 instance (if you chose to not terminate resources):
/var/log/cfn-init.log
/tmp/run-rightsizing-redshift.log
/tmp/deleteandterminate.log
